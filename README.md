# Greedy Express
Express project build with yo

We use mongodb for the database. And less for css, coffee for js. Make sure you have already started the mongod server.

In my Mac, I start the mongodb server via `mongod`.

## Run the website

This project is a nodejs server and build with gulp. You can start it:

```
npm install
```

It'll install the necessary packages declared in `package.json`. After you installed all the packages.

```
gulp
```

Visit the `localhost:3000`, when the page loads `Generator-Express MVC`. You indeed succeed.

Congratulations!
